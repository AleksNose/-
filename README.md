### About The Project
This is a full-fledged hotel management application written in the Spring Framework and React. The application was written as an educational project.

### Setup
The easiest way is to use Docker Compose:

```
git clone git@github.com:AleksNose/Hoteru.git
cd Hoteru
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

### Roadmap

There is still a long way to go for the project - At this point it is difficult for us to describe the steps to finalize the application because of the very early status.
